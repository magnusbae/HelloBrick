# IntelliJ

If you want, you may develop this project using IntelliJ. This will give you
code completion and documentation, but you will still need to build and deploy using Ant.

## Import project

In IntelliJ choose

1. File
2. Import Project
3. Choose folder
4. Choose "Create project from existing sources"

- Choose source location
- Review libraries
   - Deselect all libraries/jars found except ```ev3```
- Review module structure
- Choose JDK 1.7

## Compiling code and EV3 communication

To compile code when using IntelliJ, we suggest using the included Ant-script. See `README-ANT.md`.
