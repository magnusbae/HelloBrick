# Competition rules

## TLDR:

Two teams, four robots (each team gets two). Defend your own circle, "capture" the other teams'.
*Points are awarded only when you are on the other teams while also not having a robot on your own circle.*

## Teams & Robots

Each team get to have two robots. One for attacking, and one for defending.
